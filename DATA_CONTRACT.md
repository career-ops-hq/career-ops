# Data Contract

This document defines which files belong to the **system** (auto-updatable) and which belong to the **user** (never touched by updates).

## User Layer (NEVER auto-updated)

These files contain your personal data, customizations, and work product. Updates will NEVER modify them.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cv.md` | Your CV in markdown |
| `config/profile.yml` | Your identity, targets, comp range |
| `modes/_profile.md` | Your archetypes, narrative, negotiation scripts |
| `modes/_custom.md` | Your house rules, custom workflows & output preferences (procedural — survives updates) |
| `voice-dna.md` | Your writing voice guardrail — banned words, anti-AI-slop rules, tone (optional) |
| `article-digest.md` | Your proof points from portfolio |
| `interview-prep/story-bank.md` | Your accumulated STAR+R stories |
| `interview-prep/{company}-{role}.md` | Company-specific interview prep reports (written by `/career-ops interview-prep`) |
| `interview-prep/sessions/*.md` | Interview sessions — real transcripts + mock sessions (sensitive: real names/companies; gitignored except scaffold). Drives `patterns` Step 1b targeting signal and `interview-redflag` analysis. Scaffold files (`README.md`, `.gitkeep`) are system-owned. |
| `portals.yml` | Your customized company list |
| `config/plugins.yml` | Your plugin activation toggles (opt-in; seeded from `config/plugins.example.yml`) |
| `plugins.local/` | Your own / private plugins (never auto-updated) |
| `plugins.lock` | Integrity pins + recorded consent for your enabled plugins (generated; never auto-updated) |
| `data/applications.md` | Your application tracker (source of truth) |
| `data/applications.db` | Derived query index over `applications.md` (SQLite, rebuilt by `node tracker.mjs sync` — safe to delete) |
| `data/pipeline.md` | Your URL inbox |
| `data/scan-history.tsv` | Your scan history |
| `data/scan-runs.tsv` | Your per-run scan counters (appended by `scan.mjs`, read by `stats.mjs`) |
| `data/follow-ups.md` | Your follow-up history |
| `writing-samples/*` | Your personal writing samples for style calibration (except `writing-samples/README.md`, which is system-owned documentation delivered by updates) |
| `reports/*` | Your evaluation reports |
| `output/*` | Your generated PDFs |
| `jds/*` | Your saved job descriptions |

## The Rule

**If a file is in the User Layer, no update process may read, modify, or delete it.**

**If a file is in the System Layer, it can be safely replaced with the latest version from the upstream repo.**
