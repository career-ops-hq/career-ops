  <em>I spent months applying to jobs the hard way. So I engineered the system I wish I had.</em><br>
  Companies use AI to filter candidates. <strong>I just gave candidates AI to <em>choose</em> companies.</strong><br>
  <em>Now it's open source.</em>

## What Is This

Career-Ops ([career-ops.org](https://career-ops.org), also known as **careerops**) turns any AI coding CLI into a full job search command center. Instead of manually tracking applications in a spreadsheet, you get an AI-powered pipeline that:

- **Evaluates offers** with a structured A-F scoring system (10 weighted dimensions)
- **Generates tailored PDFs** -- ATS-optimized CVs customized per job description
- **Scans portals** automatically (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, company pages)
- **Processes in batch** -- evaluate 10+ offers in parallel with sub-agents
- **Tracks everything** in a single source of truth with integrity checks

> **Important: This is NOT a spray-and-pray tool.** Career-ops is a filter -- it helps you find the few offers worth your time out of hundreds. The system strongly recommends against applying to anything scoring below 4.0/5. Your time is valuable, and so is the recruiter's. Always review before submitting.

Career-ops is agentic: whichever AI coding CLI you choose navigates career pages with Playwright, evaluates fit by reasoning about your CV vs the job description (not keyword matching), and adapts your resume per listing.

> **Heads up: the first evaluations won't be great.** The system doesn't know you yet. Feed it context -- your CV, your career story, your proof points, your preferences, what you're good at, what you want to avoid. The more you nurture it, the better it gets. Think of it as onboarding a new recruiter: the first week they need to learn about you, then they become invaluable.

Built by someone who used it to evaluate 740+ job offers, generate 100+ tailored CVs, and land a Head of Applied AI role. [Read the full case study](https://santifer.io/career-ops-system).

## Quick Start

**Fastest way — one command:**

```bash
npx @santifer/career-ops init
```

> 💡 `npx` ships with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) — it runs the installer once,
> without installing anything globally. No Node yet? Install it first.
> (Already using a Claude Code / Gemini / Codex CLI? Then you already have it.)

This clones the latest release into `./career-ops` and installs dependencies. Then:

```bash
cd career-ops
claude   # or gemini / codex / qwen / opencode / agy — open your AI CLI here
```

**On first launch, career-ops walks you through setup — your CV, profile and target roles — just by chatting. Nothing to edit by hand.**

<details>
<summary><b>Prefer to set it up manually? (git clone)</b></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/santifer/career-ops.git
cd career-ops && npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # only needed for PDF generation

# 2. Check setup
npm run doctor                     # Validates all prerequisites

# 3. Configure
cp config/profile.example.yml config/profile.yml  # Edit with your details
cp templates/portals.example.yml portals.yml       # Customize companies

# 4. Add your CV
# Create cv.md in the project root with your CV in markdown

# 5. Personalize
claude   # Open Claude Code in this directory
opencode # Or use OpenCode

# Then ask your CLI to adapt the system to you:
# "Change the archetypes to backend engineering roles"
# "Translate the modes to English"
# "Add these 5 companies to portals.yml"
# "Update my profile with this CV I'm pasting"

# 6. Start using
# Paste a job URL or run /career-ops
```

</details>

> **The system is designed to be customized by your AI coding CLI itself.** Modes, archetypes, scoring weights, negotiation scripts -- just ask it to change them. It reads the same files it uses, so it knows exactly what to edit.

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for the full setup guide.

## Gemini & Antigravity CLI Integration

Career-ops supports [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) and Antigravity CLI natively, the same way it supports Claude Code and OpenCode. All 15 slash commands are available, using the same `modes/*.md` evaluation logic.

### Option A: Native Gemini CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install Gemini CLI (requires Node.js 20+)
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
# or: npx @google/gemini-cli --version

# 2. Run in the career-ops directory — on first launch, sign in with your
#    Google account (free) to authenticate
cd career-ops
gemini

# 3. Use the unified /career-ops command with subcommands:
/career-ops "Senior AI Engineer at Anthropic..."
/career-ops pipeline
/career-ops scan
/career-ops pdf
/career-ops tracker
```

The `GEMINI.md` file is auto-loaded as context. The skill is defined using the open standard in `.agents/skills/career-ops/SKILL.md` and symlinked/referenced for each supported CLI (e.g. `.claude/`, `.qwen/`, `.antigravitycli/`).

### Option B: Standalone API Script (No CLI install needed)

```bash
# 1. Get a free API key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env, set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Evaluate a job description
node gemini-eval.mjs "We are looking for a Senior AI Engineer..."
node gemini-eval.mjs --file ./jds/my-job.txt
npm run gemini:eval -- "JD text here"
```

> **Free tier:** Both options work without billing. Native CLI uses Google OAuth; the API script uses `gemini-2.5-flash` (15 RPM, 1M tokens/day free).

## Usage

Career-ops is a single slash command with multiple modes:

```
/career-ops                → Show all available commands
/career-ops {paste a JD}   → Full auto-pipeline (evaluate + PDF + tracker)
/career-ops scan           → Scan portals for new offers
/career-ops pdf            → Generate ATS-optimized CV
/career-ops cover          → Cover letter generator (paste JD or /career-ops cover {slug})
/career-ops batch          → Batch evaluate multiple offers
/career-ops tracker        → View application status
/career-ops apply          → Fill application forms with AI
/career-ops pipeline       → Process pending URLs
/career-ops contacto       → LinkedIn outreach message
/career-ops deep           → Deep company research
/career-ops training       → Evaluate a course/cert
/career-ops project        → Evaluate a portfolio project
```

Or just paste a job URL or description directly -- career-ops auto-detects it and runs the full pipeline.

## How It Works

## Pre-configured Portals

The scanner comes with **45+ companies** ready to scan and **19 search queries** across major job boards. Copy `templates/portals.example.yml` to `portals.yml` and add your own:

**AI Labs:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Mistral, Cohere, LangChain, Pinecone
**Voice AI:** ElevenLabs, PolyAI, Parloa, Hume AI, Deepgram, Vapi, Bland AI
**AI Platforms:** Retool, Airtable, Vercel, Temporal, Glean, Arize AI
**Contact Center:** Ada, LivePerson, Sierra, Decagon, Talkdesk, Genesys
**Enterprise:** Salesforce, Twilio, Gong, Dialpad
**LLMOps:** Langfuse, Weights & Biases, Lindy, Cognigy, Speechmatics
**Automation:** n8n, Zapier, Make.com
**European:** Factorial, Attio, Tinybird, Clarity AI, Travelperk

**Job boards searched:** Ashby, Greenhouse, Lever, Wellfound, Workable, RemoteFront

By default `node scan.mjs` (a.k.a. `npm run scan`) trusts what each ATS feed returns. Some companies leave stale postings in their public API even after the role is closed, so those expired entries can leak into `pipeline.md`. Pass `--verify` to launch Playwright after the API pass and drop expired postings before they hit the pipeline:

```bash
node scan.mjs --verify          # zero-token discovery + Playwright liveness check
```

The verification is sequential and only runs against new offers (after dedup), so the cost stays bounded.

## Dashboard TUI

The built-in terminal dashboard lets you browse your pipeline visually:

```bash
cd dashboard
go build -o career-dashboard .
./career-dashboard --path ..
```

Features: 6 filter tabs, 4 sort modes, grouped/flat view, lazy-loaded previews, inline status changes.
