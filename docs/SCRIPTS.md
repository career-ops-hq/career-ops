## doctor

Validates that all prerequisites are in place: Node.js >= 18, dependencies installed, Playwright chromium, required files (`cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `portals.yml`), fonts directory, and auto-creates `data/`, `output/`, `reports/` if missing.

```bash
npm run doctor
```

**Exit codes:** `0` all checks passed, `1` one or more checks failed (fix messages printed).

---

## verify

Health check for pipeline data integrity. Validates `data/applications.md` against seven rules: canonical statuses (per `templates/states.yml`), no duplicate company+role pairs, all report links point to existing files, scores match `X.XX/5` / `N/A` / `DUP`, rows have proper pipe-delimited format, no pending TSVs in `batch/tracker-additions/`, and no markdown bold in scores.

```bash
npm run verify
```

**Exit codes:** `0` pipeline clean (zero errors), `1` errors found. Warnings (e.g. possible duplicates) do not cause a non-zero exit.

---

## normalize

Maps non-canonical statuses to their canonical equivalents and strips markdown bold and dates from the status column. Aliases like `Enviada` become `Aplicado`, `CERRADA` becomes `Descartado`, etc. DUPLICADO info is moved to the notes column.

```bash
npm run normalize             # apply changes
npm run normalize -- --dry-run  # preview without writing
```

Creates a `.bak` backup of `applications.md` before writing.

**Exit codes:** `0` always (changes or no changes).

---

## dedup

Removes duplicate entries from `applications.md` by grouping on normalized company name + fuzzy role match. Keeps the entry with the highest score. If a removed entry had a more advanced pipeline status, that status is promoted to the keeper.

```bash
npm run dedup             # apply changes
npm run dedup -- --dry-run  # preview without writing
```

Creates a `.bak` backup before writing.

**Exit codes:** `0` always.

---

## merge

Merges batch tracker additions (`batch/tracker-additions/*.tsv`) into `applications.md`. Handles 9-column TSV, 8-column TSV, and pipe-delimited markdown formats. Detects duplicates by report number, entry number, and company+role fuzzy match. Higher-scored re-evaluations update existing entries in place.

```bash
npm run merge                 # apply merge
npm run merge -- --dry-run    # preview without writing
npm run merge -- --verify     # merge then run verify-pipeline
```

Processed TSVs are moved to `batch/tracker-additions/merged/`.

**Exit codes:** `0` success, `1` verification errors (with `--verify`).

---

## validate:portals

Validates `portals.yml` before running the scanner. The validator is offline: it reads YAML, loads local provider IDs from `providers/*.mjs`, and checks common configuration mistakes without fetching any job boards.

It reports errors for invalid YAML shape, unknown explicit providers, malformed URLs, empty filter keywords, and invalid local parser blocks. Duplicate enabled company names are warnings because they may be intentional during migrations, but they are worth reviewing.

```bash
npm run validate:portals
npm run validate:portals -- --file templates/portals.example.yml
node validate-portals.mjs --self-test
```

**Exit codes:** `0` no errors (warnings allowed), `1` one or more errors found.

---

## pdf

Renders an HTML file to a print-quality, ATS-parseable PDF via headless Chromium. Resolves font paths from `fonts/`, normalizes Unicode for ATS compatibility (em-dashes, smart quotes, zero-width characters), and reports page count and file size.

```bash
npm run pdf -- input.html output.pdf
npm run pdf -- input.html output.pdf --format=letter   # US letter
npm run pdf -- input.html output.pdf --format=a4        # A4 (default)
```

**Exit codes:** `0` PDF generated, `1` missing arguments or generation failure.

---

## build:latex

Builds a `.tex` file from a structured JSON payload, handling template merge and LaTeX escaping automatically. The JSON is produced by the agent during evaluation — this script replaces the manual LaTeX generation step in `modes/latex.md`.

```bash
node build-cv-latex.mjs input.json output.tex
node build-cv-latex.mjs --test
```

**Exit codes:** `0` file generated, `1` missing inputs, invalid JSON, unresolved placeholders, or template not found.

---

## sync-check

Validates that the career-ops setup is internally consistent: `cv.md` exists and is not too short, `config/profile.yml` exists with required fields, no hardcoded metrics in `modes/_shared.md` or `batch/batch-prompt.md`, and `article-digest.md` freshness (warns if older than 30 days).

```bash
npm run sync-check
```

**Exit codes:** `0` no errors (warnings allowed), `1` errors found.

---

## patterns

Analyzes application outcomes, scores, archetypes, blockers, remote policy, and company size from `data/applications.md` and linked reports. New reports should include `## Machine Summary` YAML; `analyze-patterns.mjs` uses it first and falls back to legacy markdown parsing for older reports.

```bash
npm run patterns
npm run patterns -- --summary
npm run patterns -- --min-threshold 3
node analyze-patterns.mjs --self-test
```

**Exit codes:** `0` analysis succeeded, `1` insufficient data or parser self-test failure.

---

## update:check

Checks whether a newer version of career-ops is available upstream. Outputs JSON to stdout:

```bash
npm run update:check
```

Possible JSON responses:

| `status` | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `up-to-date` | Local version matches remote |
| `update-available` | Newer version exists (includes `local`, `remote`, `changelog`) |
| `dismissed` | User dismissed the update prompt |
| `offline` | Could not reach GitHub |

**Exit codes:** `0` always.

---

## update

Applies the upstream update. Creates a timestamped backup branch (`backup-pre-update-<version>-<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>`), fetches from the canonical repo, checks out only system-layer files, runs `npm install`, and commits. The timestamp is derived from UTC ISO time with separators and milliseconds removed (for example, `backup-pre-update-1.8.1-20260608T071302Z`). User-layer files (`cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `data/`, etc.) are never touched.

```bash
npm run update
```

**Exit codes:** `0` success, `1` lock conflict or safety violation.

---

## rollback

Restores system-layer files from the most recent backup branch created during an update. Rollback prefers the newest timestamped branch matching `backup-pre-update-<version>-<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>` and still accepts legacy `backup-pre-update-<version>` branches for older installs.

```bash
npm run rollback
```

**Exit codes:** `0` success, `1` no backup branch found or git error.

---

## liveness

Tests whether job posting URLs are still live using headless Chromium. Detects expired patterns (e.g. "job no longer available"), HTTP 404/410, ATS redirect patterns, and apply-button presence. Supports multi-language expired patterns (English, German, French).

```bash
npm run liveness -- https://example.com/job/123
npm run liveness -- https://a.com/job/1 https://b.com/job/2
npm run liveness -- --file urls.txt
```

Each URL gets a verdict: `active`, `expired`, or `uncertain` with a reason.

**Exit codes:** `0` all URLs active, `1` any expired or uncertain.

---

## scan

Zero-token portal scanner. Runs configured local parsers for SSR/static career pages and hits ATS APIs (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever) directly — no LLM tokens consumed. Reads `portals.yml` for target companies, outputs matching listings to stdout, and optionally appends to `data/pipeline.md`.

`scan_history.recheck_after_days` in `portals.yml` lets old `added` URLs become eligible for recheck after the configured number of days. If absent, scan-history dedup keeps the historical behavior and dedups forever. Permanent invalid statuses such as blocked host and malformed URL remain permanent.

For custom SSR pages, configure a tracked company with `scan_method: local_parser` and a `parser` block. The parser can be written in JavaScript, Python, or any language available as a local executable. Company-specific parsers usually already know their source URL and only need to print JSON jobs to stdout:

```yaml
parser:
  command: node
  script: scripts/parsers/example-company-jobs.js
  format: jobs-json-v1
```

Use `args` only for reusable parsers that intentionally accept runtime parameters such as `{careers_url}` or `{company}`.

If a parser writes full extraction artifacts for debugging or audit, store them under `data/parser-output/{company}/`. `scan.mjs` reads stdout and does not require those JSON files after parsing. Keep generated JSON artifacts out of git; `.gitkeep` placeholders are the only exception for preserving directory structure.

```bash
npm run scan
```

**Exit codes:** `0` scan completed, `1` configuration error or no portals.yml found.

## scan:full

Reverse ATS discovery scanner. Where `scan.mjs` scans the companies you track in `portals.yml`, this inverts the direction: it walks public directories of companies per ATS (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday) and surfaces fresh postings matching your `portals.yml` `title_filter` / `location_filter` — no manual company curation. Company directories come from the public [job-board-aggregator](https://github.com/Feashliaa/job-board-aggregator) dataset, cached in `data/cache/` for 24 hours.

Postings without a usable publish date are skipped — a reverse scan is only useful for fresh postings. New matches are appended to `data/pipeline.md` and `data/scan-history.tsv` in the same format as `scan.mjs`.

```bash
npm run scan:full                              # all ATS directories, last 3 days
node scan-ats-full.mjs --since 7               # postings from the last 7 days
node scan-ats-full.mjs --ats greenhouse,workday # subset of sources
node scan-ats-full.mjs --limit 200             # max companies per ATS
node scan-ats-full.mjs --dry-run               # preview without writing
node scan-ats-full.mjs --liveness              # Playwright-verify matches first
node scan-ats-full.mjs --md-out notes/scans    # also write a dated markdown digest
```

**Exit codes:** `0` scan completed, `1` configuration error (no portals.yml, unknown `--ats` source) or fatal scan error.
