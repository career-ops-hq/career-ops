# Source Indexing Log

Every source that goes through the [Source Indexing Policy](../CONTRIBUTING.md#source-indexing-policy) gets an entry here: what was proposed, who proposed it, which rules were checked, and how they were verified. The point is that a stranger can reconstruct any decision from the outside without asking anyone.

Two things this log deliberately is not: a ranking, and a promise. Rule 4 says it plainly — indexing is not endorsement, and distribution is not owed.

**How to read an entry.** "Verified" means someone ran a command and reported the output, not that a claim was accepted. Where a check could only be done against a live endpoint, the entry says what was sampled and when, because live checks expire: a source that passed in August can drift in November, and re-verification is normal rather than an accusation.

**Adding an entry.** A source is logged when its provider merges. Anyone can open a [source proposal](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops/issues/new?template=source-proposal.yml); the discussion happens in the issue and the PR, and this file is the durable summary with links back to both.

First source reviewed under the written policy. The operator proposing their own board is exactly the case the rules exist for: the disclosure came first, and the rules decided rather than a conversation.

**Rule 1 (real listings, identifiable employer, free for candidates).** Verified: listings resolve to named employers, no candidate-side paywall or registration on the source.

**Rule 2 (canonical URL is the employer's).** The provider prefers each listing's upstream `applyUrl` and falls back to the board page only when that is missing or not `https:`. Verified by sampling 121 rows across pages 1, 9 and 19 of the live feed: zero rows without an employer URL, zero non-https, zero pointing back at remotli.ch. The host distribution was ordinary employer infrastructure (Greenhouse, Workday, Ashby, Lever, Recruitee, company career pages), with no tracking hop in between.

**Rule 3 (complete inventory, no paid placement).** The operator disclosed a coverage gap in his own proposal: without the `remote=all` parameter the feed serves 392 of 921 roles, 42.6% of the board. The merged provider walks all 19 pages. No promoted or sponsored field exists in the payload.

**Rule 4 (operator declared).** The [supported boards table](SUPPORTED_JOB_BOARDS.md) row carries `operator: eliador90` with a link to this policy.

**Rule 5 (aggregation stays in core).** The provider reads its own source only. Ranking and cross-source work stay where they always were.

**Also checked, outside the policy:** zero-auth (a plain `curl` with no key, cookie or session returns the feed), and two HIGH CodeQL alerts raised in review were resolved before merge.

| **Provider** | `providers/a16z-speedrun.mjs` |

Merged before the policy was written, and logged here because it is the case that prompted writing it: a large, well-connected talent network is exactly where "does indexing imply endorsement?" stops being theoretical.

**Rule 3, retroactively.** Two coverage defects were found and fixed after listing, both by contributors reading the live feed rather than the code: the page size was set to 100 while the feed serves 50, so the fetch stopped silently after one page ([#2419](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops/pull/2419)), and a single transient upstream failure aborted the whole board fetch ([#2506](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops/issues/2506)). Both are the failure mode rule 3 targets: partial coverage that reads as complete.

**Rule 4.** Listed with its operator declared. Rule 4's 40% ceiling exists so no single source, however large, dominates the registry.
