You are generating the CONTENT for a reusable General Role Resume in a non-interactive WEB worker that is already inside Career-Ops. Complete the resume in THIS SAME RUN. Do not merely acknowledge these instructions or describe what you will do.

WORKER ISOLATION: Do NOT invoke or announce any skill, skill router, interactive mode, onboarding/setup flow, doctor check, version/update check, repository-discovery workflow, or installation workflow. Do not search for alternate Career-Ops instructions. This prompt is the complete worker contract.

APPROVED PLAN
- Target Role: ${plan.targetRole}
- roleSlug: ${plan.roleSlug}
- Version: ${plan.version}
- Approved positioning: ${plan.positioning}
- CV-supported focus areas: ${plan.supportedFocusAreas.join(", ") || "none selected"}

NOW PERFORM THE TASK:
1. Read cv.md.
2. Read config/profile.yml and modes/_profile.md.
3. Read modes/pdf.md only for relevant content and formatting rules; do not enter its interactive workflow.
4. Build complete structured resume content for the approved role family and supported focus areas. The backend owns templates/cv-template.html and its two-page styling.
5. Return every schema field below. Optional content collections may be empty arrays, but fields may not be omitted.
6. Use only claims supported by cv.md. Do not invent or upgrade adjacent experience.
7. Emit the structured JSON envelope exactly once.
8. Continue until both the envelope and final VERDICT line have been emitted. Do not ask questions.

This is a content-only step. The backend owns every file and all rendering.

HARD BOUNDARY — NEVER do any of these:
- Do not create, edit, move, or save files or directories.
- Do not run Bash or any shell command to generate, validate, save, or render the resume.
- Do not run generate-pdf.mjs, verify-cv-facts.mjs, npm, setup, doctor, update-system, or any update/install workflow.
- Do not render a PDF, save HTML, choose an output path, return localhost/job links, update Career-Ops, or ask whether Career-Ops should be updated.
- Do not modify cv.md, config/profile.yml, modes/_profile.md, or any profile/application file.

Your ONLY responsibility is to read the approved sources, compose the structured resume content in memory, and emit it through the web envelope. Use cv.md as the source of truth.

This General Role Resume has NO job description, employer, company, or posting. Skip JD keyword-gap processing and company research. Do not invent an employer, posting, ATS keywords, or requirements. Tailor only to the APPROVED PLAN above.

STRICT JSON SCHEMA (unknown fields are rejected):
{"format":"letter|a4","lang":"string","name":"string","phone":"string","email":"string","linkedin":{"url":"string","display":"string"},"portfolio":{"url":"string","display":"string"},"location":"string","professionalSummary":"string","coreCompetencies":["string"],"workExperience":[{"company":"string","period":"string","role":"string","location":"string","bullets":["string"]}],"projects":[{"title":"string","description":"string","technologies":["string"],"url":"optional string","badge":"optional string"}],"education":[{"title":"string","organization":"string","year":"string","description":"optional string"}],"certifications":[{"title":"string","organization":"string","year":"string"}],"awards":[{"title":"string","organization":"string","year":"string"}],"interests":"string","skills":[{"category":"string","items":["string"]}]}

All values are plain text. Do not put HTML, Markdown, template placeholders, or CSS in any field. The backend escapes text and maps these values into the canonical template deterministically.

FINAL OUTPUT CHECK: Emit ${ROLE_JSON_OPEN_MARK} on its own line, then exactly one JSON object matching the schema, then ${ROLE_JSON_CLOSE_MARK} on its own line. Narration before the envelope is ignored; after the closing marker emit EXACTLY one final line and nothing else:
VERDICT: {5 if the complete structured envelope was emitted, else 1}/5 — {a one-line summary, ≤12 words}`;
